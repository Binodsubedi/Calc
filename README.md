  # Calculator with Tkinter
  
  ## Introduction
  This is a very simple calculator made with the use of Tkinter, a library of python which is used
  for its GUI component. It can perform very general tasks like adding, substracting, multiplying
  and dividing two numbers.
  
  ## Features of this project
  
  This is just a simple calculator so it really don't have a lot of features to talk about
  as it can only add, divide, multiply and substract. Still it is made with some user interaction
  purposes as:
  
  - It checks if the first number is entered or not
  - It reminds user to enter the second number in case when user forgets
  - It resists user from entering equal button to many times by displaying some message
  - It creates interactive session with randomized color assigned to each button
